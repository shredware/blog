Summary: Introducing our Commodore x40

## Introducing our Commodore x40

We're back for our third team member introduction: Mark Evenson is yet
another co-founder of CloudFleet.  Mark was born in Springfield, but
with five digits on each hand.  Although he holds a jaundiced view of
software development, his natural pigmentation is not yellow.


## What is your background? What did you study, what job experience do you have and in which field(s)?

After growing up in various parts of the world, I eventually made it
to Cornell University in Ithaca, NY, where I was interested in
studying either English or Physics.  Reasoning that I could always
pick up a pen to write or a book to read later on, but wouldn't always
have access to a particle accelerator to fool around with, I decided
to officially pursue the natural science route.  Having extensive
exposure to the pre-commercial Internet, I became more interested in
the computational aspects of working with a near-infrared astronomy
group attempting to image proto-stellar disks around nearby suns.
This led to a stint designing a virtual reality operating system
(MOSES) at the Human Interface Technology Laboratory in Seattle, WA.
After drifting around the states in an '87 Civic hatchback, washing
dishes and writing poetry, I found myself driving to an apartment in
Harlem, NYC on the day of Clinton's first inauguration.  While
wandering around comparing the New York I had read about with the New
York I know lived in, I was quickly swept up in the commercializing
Internet.  As it turns out, I worked for a variety of established
firms and scrappy start ups at the daybreak of what we now know as the
World Wide Web.

## What is your role in CloudFleet?

I consider myself a seasoned generalist who knows how to specialize
when needed, a sort Jack-of-all-trades and a master of the one I am
concentrating on, if you will.  Currently, I am coordinating the
engineering activities towards our "First Customer Ship", part of
which consists in designing and implementing a zero-knowledge backup
system.

##  Are you currently fully involved in CloudFleet? If not, where do you work/what do you do?

As a co-founder, I am currently "all-in" towards the minimal viable
product ship date.  In order to pay the bills before we get some
reasonable cash flow, I work as a contract software developer.  Most
recently, I designed, developed and deployed a "full stack" next
generation Electronic Health Record system rooted in semantics (first
order description logics) for the University at Buffalo School of
Dental Medicine.  We dynamically compiled a per-user specific
JavaScript bundle delivered as a HTML5 client which securely connected
via TLS to a Java Virtual Machine based application server.  I also
work on various open source projects, the most prominent being Armed
Bear Common Lisp, a language implementation that runs on a Java
Virtual Machine.

## What are some of your current interests and hobbies?

When I get the time, which is increasingly rear, I continue to do
recreational mathematics, where I currently am working through ideas
towards a systematized taxonomy of known algorithms for quantum
computers.  And, although I currently live inland, I try make what
time I can to go surfing, on real waves on a real beach.

## Why are you interested in privacy?

Instinctively, I have always been an online privacy advocate since the
first days of dialing up local BBS numbers via a 300 bp/s modem from
my Commodore 64 in the 1980s (the "x40" in my CloudFleet title is a
reference to these days, being a representation of "64" in
hexadecimal).  Over the years, my interest in privacy has come down to
the realization that we only get to build one Internet: one where
everyone can be spied on, or one on which no one can be spied on.
Privacy is not just about hiding things, it is also about how we
assert control over creating out public persona.

## In what ways do you think CloudFleet can solve the problem of privacy?

Without a local computation capable of being verified for trust one
cannot know that the interconnected computer systems we are using are
not simulations of the ones we expect.  These projections of our
mirrorworld offer us only indistinguishable simulations that may
either inadvertently or maliciously compromise control of our own
data.

## What makes you a valuable asset to CloudFleet?

A determination to not let the "Snowden moment" pass into history
without having said that I did not try to make a different world.
