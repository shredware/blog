Summary: CloudFleet brings privacy, safety and interoperability to your mails


## 1. CloudFleet Protects Your Privacy

CloudFleet stores all your mails, calendar entries, contacts and files on your
Blimp, your personal cloud storage unit safe and secure in your home. Your blimp is
designed so that only you have access to it, not even we are not able access your data
or its contents. Because of this design, no government authority can compel us to hand
over your data therefore your profile will never be sold to 3rd parties which bombard
you with targeted ads.

CloudFleet is your safe haven for your digital identity. Your Blimp
will act as your personal digital assistant completing all the preocesses directly
on the device. Data can only be extracted unless you explicitly authorize it.

To make sure that CloudFleet software on is safe from external malicious attacks or
hackers, it will be audited and scrutinized by professional security experts. Only
the services that you need to will be visible to the outside, nothing more. 

We will also offer a Two Factor Authentication which most banks use today.


## 2. CloudFleet Makes Sure Your Data is Always Accessible.

Whatever events may happen in the future, you will always be able to access
your data, anywhere on the go.

Your Blimp prevents data loss by always keeing an encrypted, updated 
copy of you data on our secure servers, just in case your device fails. Whenever the need
is there your data will be restored back to your blimp on demand.

The CloudFleet box, containing all your sensitive data belongs to you. No one but
you can cancel the service. Even if you decide to leave CloudFleets services, your Blimp
and your data will stay with you and be accessible from your home network. Your
Blimp in the Cloud.


## 3. CloudFleet Plays Nice With Others

With CloudFleet you can send emails just like any other email service. CloudFleet 
technology uses a cutting edge webmail client powered by Mailpile which allows you
to sync your emails with the ActiveSync protocol.

When needed, your emails can be encrypted. To make this easy CloudFleet uses
PGP, the standard which is most widely used to encrypt and sign emails.

CloudFleet will also synchronize your calendar appointments, contacts and cloud files
across all your devices like your mobile phone, tablet and laptop. 

CloudFleet uses the CalDAV standard for the Calendar which is understood by all
current mobile phones today and for contacts we have implemented the CardDAV standard.
