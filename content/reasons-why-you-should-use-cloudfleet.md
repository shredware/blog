Summary: CloudFleet brings privacy, safety and interoperability to your mails


## 1. CloudFleet Protects Your Privacy

CloudFleet stores all your mails, calendar entries, contacts and files on your
CloudFleet device at your home and even we have no way to access it. Because of
this no government authority can compel us to turn over your data and your
profile will not be sold to bombard you with targeted ads.

CloudFleet is the safe haven for your digital identity. The CloudFleet
device will act as your personal digital assistant doing all processing directly
on the device. Data will only leave it if you explicitly authorize it.

To make sure that the software running on CloudFleet is safe from hacking
attempts it will be audited by professional security experts and only expose to
the web what is absolutely necessary for you to use it.

We will also offer a Two Factor Authentication like you know it from your bank.

## 2. CloudFleet Makes Sure You Can Always Access To Your Data

Whatever happens in the future you will always be able to access your data.

To protect you from data loss in case your device fails, it will send an
encrypted copy of your data we will safely store for you. Whenever you need to
restore it you will be able to do it.

The CloudFleet box, with all your data on it is yours and no one can cancel the
service. Even if you decide to leave the CloudFleet services the device and your
data will stay with you and be accessible from your home network.


## 3. CloudFleet Plays Nice With Others

With CloudFleet you can send emails like you were used to. CloudFleet has a
cutting edge web mail client with Mailpile and allows you to sync your emails
with the ActiveSync protocol.

If possible, your emails will be encrypted. To make this easy CloudFleet uses
PGP, the standard that is most widely used to encrypt and sign emails.

CloudFleet will synchronize your calendar appointments and contacts across all
your devices, like you are used to.

For the Calendar CloudFleet uses the CalDAV standard that is understood by all
current mobile phones and for contacts CardDAV.
